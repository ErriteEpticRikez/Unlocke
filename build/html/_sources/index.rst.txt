Welcome to Unlocke's documentation!
===================================

Welcome to the official documentation for Unlocke, a secure solution to run remote commands, in the instance you get locked out
of your own server.


Is this secure?
=======================================
Yes! Action files are encrypted by private and public keys. Only one can encrypt and the other one can decrypt.

These are created at setup. Provided that you keep the private key and
public key apart and secured.
